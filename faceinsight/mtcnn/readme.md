# MTCNN

The code is a pytorch(=1.0.x) implementation of **inference stage** of face detection algorithm described in
[Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878).

The code inherits from [TropComplique/mtcnn-pytorch](https://github.com/TropComplique/mtcnn-pytorch).
